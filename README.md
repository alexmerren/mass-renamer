# Rename
A C++ version of a mass renaming tool I created to help me rename a bunch of files at once.

## Getting started
You need to compile the source code into something usable by your machine.
In order to compile, you must use some flags depending on what system you are on.
- macOS: `clang++ massRename.cpp -o massRename -std=c++17`
- Linux: `clang++ massRename.cpp -o massRename -std=c++17 -lstdc++fs`

## To do
- [ ] Get functionality to Windows.
